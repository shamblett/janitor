INSTALLATION
============
You need an HTTP web web server like Apache and PHP (> version 4.3) installed on this server.
On your client PC you need a web browser which supports JavaScript. I recommend using Mozilla Firefox!

Unzip the phpMyBackupPro zip file to your web servers public html directory (e.g. Apache: xxx/Apache/htdocs/).


phpMyBackupPro will only work if you complete the following 3 steps:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.) For security reasons move the file global_conf.php and the directory export to another directory and maybe change the names.
Best choice is a directory which is not public. (E.g. xxx/Apache/files/)
Attention:
On some systems phpMyBackupPro seems not to get write permissions for the export directory when it is located outside the phpMyBackupPro directory.
In this case don't move the directory but move the global_conf.php file.

2.) Open the file definitions.php in an editor and change the line 28 and 29 to the paths you moved the global_conf.php and the directory export to.
These paths must be relative to the file definitions.php. (E.g. ../files/global_conf.php but NOT c:/files/global_conf.php)

3.) Set the rights of the directory export and the file global_conf.php to 0777 (read, write and execute for all).
(E.g. execute 'chmod 0777 global_conf.php' in a bash session or use the Windows command prompt function)

Now you are (nearly) ready to use phpMyBackupPro!

Load the config.php file in your browser (e.g. http://localhost/phpMyBackupPro/config.php).
Insert your data (MySQL data, ...). You can get help for the individual pages by clicking on 'help'.
When you start phpMyBackupPro next time you will be asked to login using your MySQL username and password.

SYSTEMVARIABLES
===============

This file describes the phpMyBackupPro system variables stored in $PMBP_SYS_VARS.
Most of them are unimportant to know, but there are a few variables which activate
some special features. You can edit them on the configuration page.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['last_login']
Contains a string showing information about the last successful login.
Automatically receives the values from $PMBP_SYS_VAR['last_login'] on each login.
Modifying makes no sense.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['this_login']
Contains a string showing information about the current successful login.
Is updated automatically on each login.
Changing makes no sense.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['security_key']
Contains a md5 hash wich will never change automatically.
This key must be set in the scheduled backup scripts to trigger a backup.
It avoids backups triggered by someone else than your backup scripts.
If you change this key, don't forget to update you backup scripts.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['dir_lists']
Controls the directory levels, listed on the 'backup' and 'schedule backup' pages.
Set to "0" to list no directories, set to "1" to list only directories on level "../",
set to "2" to list directories on level "../" and "../../". (including subdirectories)
Try setting to "0" or "1" if you have problems loading the backup pages.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['memory_limit']
Specifies how many characters will be stored in the memory before backups are
written to the disk. This value only takes effect if ini_get("memory_limit") fails.
Try to increase the value to speed up backups.
Try to decrease the value to fix memory limit problems. (E.g. "19000000" for 2 mb)

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['scheduled_debug']
Controlls debug output in scheduled backup mode.
If set to "1", scheduled backups produce html output for debuging.
If set to "1" and NO debug output is generated, "backup.php" was not found.
Do not forget to set back to "0" after debugging!

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['schedule_all_dbs']
Controls which databases are backed up in scheduled backup mode.
If set to "1", all available databases will be backed up.
If set to "0", only the selected databses will be backed upd
You can use this feature if the databases on your server change frequently.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['except_tables']
Enter a list of database table names, which should not be included in backups.
E.g. if set to "test,log" the tables test and log are excluded in all backups
of all databases! It is not possible to exclude tables from a single database.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['scheduled_file']
$PMBP_SYS_VAR['scheduled_dir']
Contains the values entered on the schedule backup page for the file name and
directory for the scheduled-backup script.
Do not change manually but use the schedule backup page.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['last_scheduled']
Contains the timestamp when the last scheduled backup was executed.
Can be reset to 0 to force a backup the next time a scheduled backup script is called.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['last_scheduled_...']
Contains the timestamp when the last scheduled backup was executed for the accounts
in global_conf_sql.php. The enumeration starts with 0 and the order is the same as
in in global_conf_sql.php and the accounts selection in phpMyBackupPro.
Can be reset to 0 to force a backup the next time a scheduled backup script is called.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['ftp_timeout']
The time in seconds how long it may need to open a connection to a FTP server.
Can be set to a higher value if there are problems when connecting to a FTP server.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['dir_email_backup']
Specifies if directory backups are send by email.
Set to 1 to send directory backups additional by email. If you don't want to send
them also via FTP you can enter an invallid FTP server url on the configuration page.


$PMBP_SYS_VAR['F_...']
All system variables beginning with F_ contain selections made on the export or the
schedule backup page.
Normally there is no need to edit them manually.

$PMBP_SYS_VAR['EXS_...']
All system variables beginning with EXS_ contain selections made on the schedule backup
page. They concern special settings for scheduled backups.
Normally there is no need to edit them manually.

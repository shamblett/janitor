SEVERAL SERVERS
===============

You can use one phpMyBackupPro installation to manage the MySQL backups on several servers.
To do this, install phpMyBackupPro like described in INSTALL.txt first.

Then move the file global_conf_sql.php to another directory. Best location is the same directory as global_conf.php.
Then update line 33 in definitions.txt (See line 35 for further explanations.)

Set the rights of the file global_conf_sql.txt to 0777 (chmod 0777 global_conf_sql.php)

Then insert all you SQL server data and login data in the file. You will find an example in the file.
Don't insert the server/account data you have already entered under 'configuration' in phpMyBackupPro.
This username and password will be your login data for the web interface.

Ready!

phpMyBackupPro will recognize the changes. You will see a new drop down box above the menu,
where you can switch to the server you want to work on.

phpMyBackupPro tries to create one subfolder in your export folder for each server .
If this should fail, you will have to create the folders manually. You will see the error message
'Could not store database' when a backup failed because the folder does not exist.

At the moment it is not possible to backup databases from several accounts with one single scheduled backup script.
You have to create one script for each account. You have to update all scripts if you decrease the number of accounts or their order.

Please consider donating to phpMyBackupPro. Thank you!
